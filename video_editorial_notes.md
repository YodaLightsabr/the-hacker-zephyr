**7/8/21**

Drone?

Talk with Woody separately about the performers

Inform students and other folks on train/tours that I'll be there to film - have a plan for Rebecca in SpaceX, money shots

NYC - LA Hackathon going through rural areas/no internet

We purchased a server, 60lbs, on board we are creating our own internet called the Zephyrnet

We want this hackathon to be collaborative, they have to make 500 contributions by LA or everything is erased

**6/29/21 Video editorial meeting notes**

1. Morning of 15th casual interview in the morning
2. 21st/22nd in SFO.. 1 hour or 2 to get interviews or audio

Time capsule of the experience

Photo album of the key moments, how it would feel if i were the student coming and experiencing Vermont, the train, landscape.. Capturing magical moments

Day to day.. Conversations, projects.. The kids voices need to come through.. They need to teel their story… like how HC works… you give them the platform, they drive it...

Sprinkled moments of surprise.. Work time and play time

The audience should be the ones who were on board not marketing to parents, colleges)

Emotional journey + Physical/Technical journey

Theme - taking risks and taking an adventure, coming of age

Coding is really important.. But people are becoming people…

Show collaborative moments

Show the group story..

Rebecca - id like to interview around 7 students who would be interested in talking to camera.. Some can be confident, some can be shy… just to get some key statements

Shoot 2-3 kids having a conversation

We are planning this journey in 1 of the best infrastructure built in America (the path we're taking was the first ones joined and could do cross country)

Our kids are some of the most technical folks on earth!

There's no internet on board, so we are challenging them to build stuff "Zephyrnet"

We should spotlight the things that are real.

Woody will get stock video of train

1 more meeting on July 8, 1:00 pm.

1. The Grand Hyatt is right by the Bart and the Ferry. Might be nice to take some shots of students taking the bart, and definitely a group of students/HQ team maybe walking on the Ferry

2. This will be the most beautiful hotel we've booked. Interior shots of the lobby/atrium is a must, hopefully with students. If we shoot students in rooms as well, might be nice to take it in SF.

3. Not sure if kids want to go to the Exploratorium, might have great shots too
