# Invite Call Script

> This script was not intended to be directly followed during a call– this should give you a general sense, however.

-   Congratulations, we'd like to invite you onboard the Hacker Zephyr
    
-   Dates are July 15-25
    
-   Please observe the right invitation etiquette: don't share this outside your immediate family until we announce all invites have gone out. The invite can be recalled if you share details
    
-   I'll email you with an information packet that has all the basic info
    
-   Your next step is to confirm your invite– you have 7 days to do so. You’ll get a docusign emailed to you (and your parent if under 18)
   
-   If you're under 18, you'll need parent consent to confirm your invite– more info is in the packet, but we’re only talking with you. Parent webinar info is available
    
-   We're so happy to have you on this trip
