# The Hacker Zephyr ðŸš‚

This repository is to contain the open sourced planning, finances, and code behind [The Hacker Zephyr](https://zephyr.hackclub.com), the longest hackathon to ever happen on land (3,520 miles).

To-do for wrap-up more generally:

- [ ] Final email sent out to all on board

- [ ] Everyone on team gets all their reimbursements in

- [ ] Pay all contractors / actors, including any bonuses

- [ ] Thank you notes

- [ ] Lost playing cards, lost Diamond Age books

- [ ] Get a bunch of money from American Airlines for messing up so many flights and stranding Hack Clubbers

To-do for open sourcing:

- [ ] Planning documents. What's the best format for these? Maybe narrative form?

- [ ] Comb and annotate finances so Bank is ready to open source

- [ ] Read-only version of ZephyrNET online

## Structure for open sourcing

Four parts to open sourcing:

1. Aggregate planning docs
2. Write-ups:

   - Deploy flow / how the ZephyrNET works
   - Finances / the money behind it
   - How we got the train / train problems / Melody's post

3. Bank transparency mode
4. ZephyrNET read-only mode

### Outline ideas by Zach

Should this be in narrative form? Or maybe just link all the files?

---

Ideation

Securing the train (maybe share emails?)

Announcement

Invitation process - The why behind it and the execution of it itself

ZephyrNET / Hackathon purpose (What we wanted to accomplish / what we didn't want to happen)

Day-of schedule

Funding

Finances
