# ðŸš‚ The Hacker Zephyr 

Every summer Hack Clubbers do something special.

In 2019, 75 Hack Club leaders gathered in San Francisco for [Flagship](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO3hb2mN-Q16icE-M16d-06uHyXLmvd3Rw6b_f_oosfAX9SnOvnouPOyO79P7pR7Q?key=anphZTNFUERPWXV3YnJQV2VzVVVFMFFVcGRDc3hB).

In 2020, 300 Hack Clubbers received $50,000 for [hardware projects](https://summer.hackclub.com). We launched Scrapbook, and hosted the [Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com).

**In 2021, we're chartered a train, the [Hacker Zephyr](https://zephyr.hackclub.com), across America.**

We began at Hack Club HQ in Burlington, Vermont, travelled down south to New York City, west through Chicago, and crossed the Rockies on our way to San Francisco. From there, we followed the Pacific Ocean and finished at SpaceX in Los Angeles.

Onboard, we hosted the world's longest hackathon on land: 3,502 miles long.

This repository contains the open sourced [planning documents](https://github.com/hackclub/the-hacker-zephyr#-planning-documents), [finances](https://github.com/hackclub/the-hacker-zephyr#-finances), and [code](https://github.com/hackclub/the-hacker-zephyr#-associated-code-repositories) behind the Hacker Zephyr.

## ðŸ’µ Finances

The finances for the Hacker Zephyr have been open sourced [here](http://bank.hackclub.com/train) through Hack Club Bank's [transparency mode](https://twitter.com/hackclub/status/1262471150963130374).

## To Do

To-do for wrap-up more generally:

- [ ] Final email sent out to all on board

- [ ] Everyone on team gets all their reimbursements in

      - [x] Zach Latta
      - [ ] Max
      - [ ] Zach Fogg
      - [ ] Christina
      - [ ] Tina
      - [ ] Woody
      - [ ] Matthew

- [ ] Anything Hack Club needs to get reimbursed for from teammates (ex. ticket costs)

- [ ] Pay all contractors / actors, including any bonuses

- [ ] Thank you notes

- [ ] Lost playing cards, lost Diamond Age books

- [ ] Get a bunch of money from American Airlines for messing up so many flights and stranding Hack Clubbers

  - At least $196 x 2 for hotels for Lux and Rebecca when AA stranded them

  - Additional $401.40 + $161.25 charges on Max's cards when they said they'd only charge $120 for UM fee

To-do for open sourcing:

- [ ] Planning documents. What's the best format for these? Maybe narrative form?

- [ ] Comb and annotate finances so Bank is ready to open source

  - Flagging now that there are some travel expenses that I (Zach) don't remember us approving

- [ ] Read-only version of ZephyrNET online

## Structure for open sourcing

Four parts to open sourcing:

1. Aggregate planning docs
2. Write-ups:

   - Deploy flow / how the ZephyrNET works
   - Finances / the money behind it
   - How we got the train / train problems / Melody's post

3. Bank transparency mode
4. ZephyrNET read-only mode

### Outline ideas by Zach

Should this be in narrative form? Or maybe just link all the files?

---

Ideation

Securing the train (maybe share emails?)

Announcement

Invitation process - The why behind it and the execution of it itself

ZephyrNET / Hackathon purpose (What we wanted to accomplish / what we didn't want to happen)

Day-of schedule

Funding

Finances
