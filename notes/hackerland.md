# Hackerland


Goal onboard the Zephyr: Create Hackerland. A world different then our own where imaginations can be big, projects are started (sometimes finished), ambitious & imaginative. People are learning from each other. Attendees are humble. It’s paradise for hackers.

Hackerland...

-   Is Kind
    
-   Makes no assumptions & doesn’t treat people
    
-   Doesn’t care about status, credentials, degrees
    
-   Wins are celebrated (no matter how small)
    
-   Encourages independence
    
-   Is not reductive & encourages romanticism
    
-   Already exists… it’s a place all hackers have been to, whether at 3am working on OSS, working at a company with an innovative idea, or a state of mind while working on a project. It’s all around us in the real world, and the goal of the zephyr is to create hackerland for the participants

Structure / rituals

-   Rituals provide structure to the day
    
-   Standups with your crew in morning
    
-   Feed yourself is a ritual
    
-   Dinner & Demos is a ritual
    
-   Contributing an artifact to the zephyr/zephyrnet is a ritual
    
Standups in morning start in NYC. Your goal for NYC should be a physical contribution to the Zephyrnet. You physically touch the Atlantic ocean to start the event & have all of today to do it. Bring an artifact to dinner. The theme is “biggest apple”. You present your artifact at dinner demos.

Public & private artifacts allowed (separate public & private contribution bags)

New theme ideas are generated at dinner & put into conductor hat, to be announced the next day at breakfast. Every day has a new theme & contributes to the zephyrnet.

Story time at night. Ex: 10 minute monologue from shakespeare in battery park.

Multi-day projects are fine, but discouraged.

Theme changes on every logical stop (NYC -> Chicago, Chicago -> SF, etc.)
