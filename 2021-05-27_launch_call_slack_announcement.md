# Slack announcement for launch call

_This is a draft of what was eventually posted here: https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0266FRGT/p1622070025076300_

Gather ‘round hacker-folk, your attention please!

Some special news has come our way, and we’d like to share these good-tidings with everyone out there.

We’ll get together **this Saturday (6 PM Eastern / 3 PM Pacific)** to spread the news with you. Anyone in the Slack is free to join the call, but the news will only directly impact those of you **who can be in the US in the last 2 weeks of July**.

Please react to this message with a 🎟️ to reserve your spot on the call. An attendant will come by later with a ticket punch & they’ll give further details.
---
Messages with a 🎟️ will get a DM from Orpheus with a link to the call.
30 min before the call on Saturday Orpheus will send a reminder message in slack.
