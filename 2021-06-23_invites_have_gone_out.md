# Invites have gone out post

_This is a draft to be posted once we have confirmation from the last invitees._

Hey all! It’s Wednesday, June 23rd. All of the invites for the Hacker Zephyr have gone out.

For those that haven’t received an invite, please don’t be hard on yourself. This isn’t a measure of value or worth, but an artifact of physical constrains. Each and every staff member at HQ had a group of people they would have loved to see invited but couldn’t.

The list of invites will be published once all invitees have their documents & travel plans finalized. Please hang tight a little longer before asking people if they were invited.

Lastly, we’ve had some questions about the invitation packet. We’ll publish it when we have time.
