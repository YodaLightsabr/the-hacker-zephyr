-   All students must wear masks and observe a two meters social distancing rule.
    
-   Movement (such as going to get tested) will happen in groups of a maximum size of ten, including a staff supervisor. Room partners must be in the same group.

The COVID-positive student:

-   The student will be in a strict quarantine. They may not leave their room or sleeping quarters. Their partner must vacate the room.
    
-   No physical interaction is allowed with this student. Food dropped outside their room.
    
-   Staff members video call the student every two hours to ensure they are abiding by quarantine rules and check in with them personally.
    
-   Hotel to be alerted and any instructions provided by them to be followed.
    
-   Students' health to be monitored, if needed an ambulance to be called and they will be moved to hospital care.
    
If more students test positive:

-   Above measures in “the COVID-positive student” to be followed for this student.
    
Plan going forward:

-   All negative passengers may continue the journey. Unless fifthteen passengers test positive, in which case the viability of the trip should be carefully assessed.
    
-   Positive students will have their hotel room bookings extended.
    
-   They will be joined by a negative testing staff member that will remain in the city and not continue the journey. If more than five students test positive, then a second negative staff member will have to join the group. If more than ten test positive, three staff negative members will be required to stay.
