**Post Call Invite Email**


Thanks for hopping on a call and congratulations!

We are pleased to extend you an invitation to join us from July 15-25th to ride The Hacker Zephyr!

For posterity, here’s what we covered on the call:

-   Please observe the right invitation etiquette: don't share this outside your immediate family until we announce all invites have gone out. The invite can be recalled if you share details.
    
-   Your next step is to confirm your invite– you have 7 days to do so. You’ll get a docusign emailed to you (and your parent if under 18)
    
-   If you're under 18, you'll need parent consent to confirm your invite– more info is in the packet
    

Going forward, please confirm your attendance by signing the document sent by DocuSign.

You can find an information packet that includes everything you need to know about the trip attached (now at attendee_welcome_packet.pdf on GitHub).

If you have any questions regarding the packet or the Zephyr, please feel free to contact us!

Looking forward to meeting you next month,

**4/7/21 (Monday) - Packing List & Waiver**

Ahoy there!

I feel like I can hear the train in the distance– next Thursday is getting oh so close! We’re really excited to get to meet you next week!

It’d suck to realize you forgot to pack something important right as you’re heading down the runway, so we’ve compiled the ultimate packing list, which you can print out and check off as you pack.

To be able to participate, you are required to fill out the “Liability Release Waiver” that will be sent to your email in the coming days. We ask that you read this waiver thoroughly and with your parents so that you understand it fully. This waiver will be sent to your email through DocuSign. You will first need to sign it yourself and it will then be subsequently emailed to your parents for their signatures.

If you have not yet, please submit your roommate requests to Tina (tina@hackclub.com) by tomorrow. If you need a laptop please make that request to Sam (sam@hackclub.com) ASAP.

Please do reach out to us if you have any questions, we are available on Slack or through the zephyr@hackclub.com email group. We will do our best to assist you ASAP.

Looking forward to next Thursday!

Max, Sam, and the whole Zephyr team.

**6/7/21 (Tuesday) - Waiver Update**

Greetings!

I hope you’re having a great day and you’re excited for the Hacker Zephyr!

As we mentioned yesterday, to be able to participate, you are required to fill out the “Liability Release Waiver”. The “Liability Release Waiver” has now been sent to your email through DocuSign. You will first need to sign it yourself and it will then be subsequently emailed to your parents for their signatures.

Please sign this waiver by this Friday. Thank you for helping us get this processed.

All the best,

Sam, Max, and the whole Zephyr team.
