**4/7/21 (Monday) - Packing List & Waiver**

Ahoy there!

I feel like I can hear the train in the distance– next Thursday is getting oh so close! We’re really excited to get to meet you next week!

It’d suck to realize you forgot to pack something important right as you’re heading down the runway, so we’ve compiled the ultimate packing list, which you can print out and check off as you pack.

To be able to participate, you are required to fill out the “Liability Release Waiver” that will be sent to your email in the coming days. We ask that you read this waiver thoroughly and with your parents so that you understand it fully. This waiver will be sent to your email through DocuSign. You will first need to sign it yourself and it will then be subsequently emailed to your parents for their signatures.

If you have not yet, please submit your roommate requests to Tina (tina@hackclub.com) by tomorrow. If you need a laptop please make that request to Sam (sam@hackclub.com) ASAP.

Please do reach out to us if you have any questions, we are available on Slack or through the zephyr@hackclub.com email group. We will do our best to assist you ASAP.

Looking forward to next Thursday!

Max, Sam, and the whole Zephyr team.

**6/7/21 (Tuesday) - Waiver Update**

Greetings!

I hope you’re having a great day and you’re excited for the Hacker Zephyr!

As we mentioned yesterday, to be able to participate, you are required to fill out the “Liability Release Waiver”. The “Liability Release Waiver” has now been sent to your email through DocuSign. You will first need to sign it yourself and it will then be subsequently emailed to your parents for their signatures.

Please sign this waiver by this Friday. Thank you for helping us get this processed.

All the best,

Sam, Max, and the whole Zephyr team.
