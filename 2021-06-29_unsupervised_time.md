_Exported from Max's personal notes_

# Unsupervised time

Couple cases:

**What I think it should be in my head:**

- Roam free, sticking with a group is optional
- Drive to explore comes from self, kick-started by contributing an artifact to the zephyr net
- treasure hunt / list of New York locations to explore (ex. National Geographic map of Disneyland)
- meet back at hotel before dinner & head out to dinner together. Built in padding for stragglers
- 6 are assigned to staff, have a home-base group of staff that checks in with each hacker every 2 hours

**What I’ve heard from others:**

- Use buddy system (doesn’t have to be 2, just a group of friends)
- Provide a treasure hunt or recommended list of locations/activities for people who don’t naturally start exploring

**Experience for those without waivers:**

- Small groups (7-8 if we don’t have any waivers signed, 2-3 if we have most waivers signed) go out with staff supervision
- Location sharing through phone
