# To Do

To-do for wrap-up more generally:

- [ ] Final email sent out to all on board

- [ ] Everyone on team gets all their reimbursements in

  - [x] Zach Latta
  - [ ] Max
  - [ ] Zach Fogg
  - [ ] Christina
  - [ ] Tina
  - [ ] Woody
  - [ ] Matthew

- [ ] Anything Hack Club needs to get reimbursed for from teammates (ex. ticket costs)

- [ ] Pay all contractors / actors, including any bonuses

- [ ] Thank you notes

- [ ] Lost playing cards, lost Diamond Age books

- [ ] Get a bunch of money from American Airlines for messing up so many flights and stranding Hack Clubbers

  - At least $196 x 2 for hotels for Lux and Rebecca when AA stranded them

  - Additional $401.40 + $161.25 charges on Max's cards when they said they'd only charge $120 for UM fee

To-do for open sourcing:

- [ ] Planning documents. What's the best format for these? Maybe narrative form?

- [ ] Comb and annotate finances so Bank is ready to open source

  - Flagging now that there are some travel expenses that I (Zach) don't remember us approving

- [ ] Read-only version of ZephyrNET online

## Structure for open sourcing

Four parts to open sourcing:

1. Aggregate planning docs
2. Write-ups:

   - Deploy flow / how the ZephyrNET works
   - Finances / the money behind it
   - How we got the train / train problems / Melody's post

3. Bank transparency mode
4. ZephyrNET read-only mode

### Outline ideas by Zach

Should this be in narrative form? Or maybe just link all the files?
