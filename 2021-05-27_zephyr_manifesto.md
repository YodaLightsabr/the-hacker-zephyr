# Zephyr Manifesto

_This was originally written to go on the signup page at zephyr.hackclub.com_

Every summer Hack Club does something special.

In 2019 we brought 75 Hack Club leaders to San Francisco for Flagship. Last year, we gave a student $50k to distribute as hardware grants, launched scrapbook, and hosted the summer of making.

This year, we’re chartering a train across America, and hosting the world’s longest hackathon (in miles).

We’re starting at Hack Club HQ in Burlington Vermont, heading south to New York City, then crossing the rockies on our way to San Francisco, and end in Los Angeles.

On the trip you’ll code, make music, build, and write poetry. On the train you’ll meet startup founders, an acrobat, 3 political exiles, and a philosopher.

This trip is a gift from Hack Club to you and asks nothing in return. We want this to be a special, eclectic, and thought-provoking journey that you’ll remember for the rest of your life.

If you’re interested in joining us, please register your interest below. We are trying to fit as many Hack Clubbers as we can on The Hacker Zephyr.
