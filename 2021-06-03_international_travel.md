# International travel

_For posting in Slack once country list is filled out_

Hey all! Wanted to make a quick post for anyone international whoâ€™s eyes glazed over when they googled for visa options. Hereâ€™s what to do sorted by what country youâ€™re in:

Are you a citizen of one these countries and donâ€™t have a US Visa? 
```
Andorra ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡©
Australia ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º
Brunei ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡³
Chile ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡±
Japan ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ
Monaco ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¨
New Zealand ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¿
San Marino ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡²
Singapore ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬
South Korea ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡·
Taiwan ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼
```
**You donâ€™t need to do anything for a visa before youâ€™re invited to the Zephyr**. Once youâ€™re accepted weâ€™ll help you file for something called ESTAâ€“ if approved, itâ€™ll let you come into the US. Thereâ€™s no need to apply for it now, and if you apply after youâ€™re invited to the Zephyr weâ€™ll pay the application fees. Oh, and make sure to not go to [one of these countries 2 weeks before the trip](https://gist.github.com/maxwofford/78836bfda410a8240d797affff229466)

**You donâ€™t need to do anything for a visa before youâ€™re invited to the Zephyr.** You should still apply, but I want to temper your expectations: thereâ€™s a ban on flying directly from these countries. Weâ€™ll be in touch about options, but either the ban will have to be lifted, or youâ€™ll have to arrange staying in another country (not on this list) for 2 weeks before the trip. **Please donâ€™t set anything in stone before you receive an invite**. For the time being, just focus on applying & getting your vaccination if available.

Are you a citizen in another country & donâ€™t have a US Visa? You should still register your interest, but we donâ€™t have a mechanism to get you into the country right now. The regular visa process requires consulates, and those are shut down due to COVID. If youâ€™re invited weâ€™ll do whatever we can to help you get here.
