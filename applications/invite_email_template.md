Thanks for hopping on a call and congratulations!

We are pleased to extend you an invitation to join us from July 15-25th to ride The Hacker Zephyr!

For posterity, hereâ€™s what we covered on the call:

-   Please observe the right invitation etiquette: don't share this outside your immediate family until we announce all invites have gone out. The invite can be recalled if you share details.
-   Your next step is to confirm your inviteâ€“ you have 7 days to do so. Youâ€™ll get a docusign emailed to you (and your parent if under 18)
-   If you're under 18, **you'll need parent consent to confirm your inviteâ€“ more info is in the packet**
- _Other details covered in the call with the participant_

**Going forward, please confirm your attendance by signing the document sent by DocuSign.**

You can find an information packet that includes everything you need to know about the trip attached [[now here](./attendee_welcome_packet.pdf)].

If you have any questions regarding the packet or the Zephyr, please feel free to contact us!

Looking forward to meeting you next month,
