# Hacker Zephyr – Register Your Interest

ALL ABOARD!!!!! For ten days this summer, 42 Hack Clubbers will journey from East to West by train. From 🌲Vermont to ☀️Los Angeles, you'll code, build, write songs and make friends. 

Let us know here if you'd like to join us. 

This form is a pre-registration form; it only indicates strong interest, and is not a commitment to go on the trip. After you fill this out, you'll receive more information in a few days.

As much as we'd like to include every Hack Clubber on this trip, restrictions from the rail switching station in Denver limits the number of train cars we can chain together. Only 42 Hack Clubbers can fit.

We want to bring the 42 Hack Clubbers who this trip will personally impact the most. Think of it as a "soul-need based" invitation process. It is likely that some active community members who want to go won't be able to because of this. The invitation process has everything to do with how much this trip will personally impact each attendee. We wish you all could come.

For any questions, shoot an email to zephyr@hackclub.com. 💖🚃💻💨

— Orpheus, your conductor
