Greetings!

I hope you’re having a great day and you’re excited for the Hacker Zephyr!

As we mentioned yesterday, to be able to participate, you are required to fill out the “Liability Release Waiver”. The “Liability Release Waiver” has now been sent to your email through DocuSign. You will first need to sign it yourself and it will then be subsequently emailed to your parents for their signatures.

Please sign this waiver by this Friday. Thank you for helping us get this processed.

All the best,

Sam, Max, and the whole Zephyr team.
