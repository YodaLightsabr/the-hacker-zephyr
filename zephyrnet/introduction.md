Welcome to the ZephyrNET. We couldn't access the internet on the train, so we built our own.

**The challenge:** Make 500 contributions to the ZephyrNET before we arrive in Los Angeles.

Every night, we demo. Every contribution is valid: you can make a game, publish a poem, edit and share some photos, create a CTF over SSH, make a hardware project, or hack something else entirely. If you can somehow capture what you make and put it on the ZephyrNET, it counts.

The ZephyrNET is a time capsule. When we arrive back in Vermont, it'll be converted into read-only mode and put online at [https://zephyrnet.hackclub.com](https://zephyrnet.hackclub.com/), where it will live as long as Hack Club does (hopefully forever). [https://deploy.zephyr](https://deploy.zephyr/) will turn into [https://deploy.zephyrnet.hackclub.com](https://deploy.zephyrnet.hackclub.com/).

10 days is a long time for a hackathon, so we're relying on you to contribute and think of yourself as a co-organizer to help make the Zephyr a special experience for yourself and everyone else around you. We encourage you to make multiple smaller projects, and ship something each day, rather than try and build one massive project. That will also give you an opportunity to work with new people and multiple teams.

Over the course of the journey, we are largely releasing you and creating an environment - both on and off the train - where you will have a lot of freedom. What will you experience? What will you build? What kind of person will you be on the Zephyr?

Thank you for being here. We're here to support and are looking forward to seeing what we all make together.

Sincerely,

The Zephyr Team
