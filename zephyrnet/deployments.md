# Introduction
Below are exerpts from the private ZephyrNET planning repository created to work through deploy flowsâ€”initially, we created a captive-portal based authentication flow on an open network, then moving to a private-network based deploy flow.

# Hotspot popup

1. I connect to a network named "ZephyrNET" on my MacBook Air
2. There is a popup, like what I see on airport WiFi networks, that says "Welcome to the ZephyrNET" and has a directory of all the different things on the ZephyrNET (kind of like the Hidden Wiki)
3. I am able to access everything on the ZephyrNET without having to click "Approve" or "Accept" anywhere on the popup. It doesn't actually block access to the rest of the ZephyrNET, like other captive portals do.
