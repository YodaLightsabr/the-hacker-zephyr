# Deployments

The core idea behind Zephyr was to run a hackathon on a train. Hackathons exist almost purely as a way for like-minded builders to do what they do best: build. However, we quickly ran into an issue with the very notion of building on a train: there isn't any form of internet. Putting Starlink onto the train car itself would've been a non-starter, considering the fact that the clearance between the top of the train and the tunnels we'd be going through is far shorter than the satellite receiver.

All of this meant that hackers onboard the train would have to build the Internet by themselvesâ€”without NPM, PyPi, Vercel, Heroku, DigitalOcean, or anything else that developers usually take for granted. For the organizing team, however, it meant that we needed to provide an efficient way for students to deploy their ideas: building the Internet means actually, well, building it.
