# Freedom waiver

_How do we communicate the freedom/supervision waiver to attendees/parents?_

During our stops in various cities, we have blocks of “exploration time” for participants to take in the sights/sounds/smells of a city they’ve never been in. Many members of our own team remember fondly the first times we were let loose to explore in a city, and we’d like to provide a similar experience to participants.

Participants with their supervision waiver signed, or 18 and above, will have the chance to explore the city unsupervised. We will have geo-limits and curfew, because we have a train to catch.

Those who are under 18 without the waiver signed will need to stay under staff supervision during our exploration time. Staff members will break into groups of participants and travel in each city together.
