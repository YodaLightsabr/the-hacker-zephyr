# Pre-Zephyr Email to Slack members

Hey everyone, you’re getting this because you’re on the Hack Club Slack.

Summer is almost upon us. Within the next couple weeks to month, the daily commitment of attending school will end.

When we started this school year, most people were attending school remotely. Many had only partial school weeks.

Hack Club itself became remote— we provided zoom accounts to our clubs and workshop bounties for remote contributions. Instead of most activity happening IRL clubs with collaboration  over Slack, all activity shifted to Slack.

At least in the US we’re starting to feel things shift back to normal — it’s the end of the end of the world. Hopefully it will feel that way internationally soon.

We’ve been dreaming of this moment for a long time at HQ, and we’re exited to announce our summer plans.

We’ll get together this Saturday (6 PM Eastern / 3 PM Pacific) to spread the news with you. Anyone in the Slack is free to join the call, but the news will only directly impact those of you **who can be in the US in the last 2 weeks of July**.

Hey everyone, you’re getting this because you’re on the Hack Club Slack.

I’ve got some special news about Hack Club’s summer plans & wanted to invite you to our call, Saturday (6 PM Eastern / 3 PM Pacific) where we’ll announce it. Anyone in the Slack is free to join the call, but the news will only directly impact those of you **who can be in the US in the last 2 weeks of July**.

I can’t give away anything else until the call, but I want to say we’ve at HQ have been dreaming of this moment for a long time now. At least in the US we’re starting to feel things shift back to normal — it’s the end of the end of the world.
