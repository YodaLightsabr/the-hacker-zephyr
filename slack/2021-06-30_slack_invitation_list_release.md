:hack_club: hey everyone! :hack_club:

after a massive logistics operation, which included just colossal efforts to get everyone vaccinated, coordinating with embassies and governments, and - in one case - someone literally traveling across the entire world with 24 hour notice :alarm_clock:... i'm happy to be able to share the final passenger list of everyone who will be on the Zephyr.

this has been an extremely difficult and emotionally exhausting process. due to physical constraints, we simply weren't able to invite everyone we wished we could. there were many factors at play in who we extended invitations to. people who received invitations are not better than people who didn't. please, please understand the level of sincerity we are bringing to this :black_heart:

our goal is to open source the Zephyr, including the finances :bank-hackclub:, planning, trip materials, code, and more. as we have more updates on that, i'm going to share more here :eyes:. additionally, there will be opportunities to get involved in the Zephyr without being a passenger on board, including meeting up with us in-person in various cities, contributing code or data to ZephyrNET, and more :sparkles:

without further ado, please see the thread below for the final boarding list.
