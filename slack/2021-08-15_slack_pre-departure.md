Last night, we had a final get together in Vermont before everyone on The Hacker Zephyr arrives. Right now, as I'm writing this, there are about 40 Hack Clubbers in the air.

This is actually happening. I can feel the magic already.

When I first learned about the hacker ethos as a teenager, I felt like I had finally found my people. And later, I dropped out of high school and moved hundreds of miles away from home when I was 16 to be near them.

I started Hack Club because I so desperately wish I had a place like this. I never had friends my age and the hacker ethos is too powerful an idea to be left to the corners of the internet. When we were struggling to pay rent each month, I always dreamed that someday we would be able run grand initiatives like The Hacker Zephyr to bring Hack Clubbers together. Now it's actually happening.

I am humbled by all of you. You are what makes Hack Club so special. I'm going to be largely offline for the next 10 days, along with many staff, and I am going to miss you. While we're out, @sampoder is taking over the Slack and has a bunch of events and activities planned. I can think of no better person.

Sam, godspeed. And please wish us luck. We're going to open source everything about the trip afterwards. All the code, finances, as many planning documents as possible, everything. This is an anti-hackathon, and I hope it will be special.
