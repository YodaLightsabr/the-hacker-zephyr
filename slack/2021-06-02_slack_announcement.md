For those who couldn't make it, **this summer we're chartering a train:** **_The Hacker Zephyr_**.

After 40+ meetings with groups in America‚Äôs train industry, we're sending 42 Hack Clubbers on a 10 day voyage from Hack Club HQ in Burlington, Vermont to Los Angeles, California, where we'll end at SpaceX.Onboard, we're hosting the world's longest hackathon on land: 3,502 miles long. _The Hacker Zephyr_ will take place from July 15th to July 25th and will stop in New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles**_._** 

Together, we'll cross the Great Plains, wind through the Rocky Mountains, follow the coast of California, and more. This trip is a gift from Hack Club to you and asks nothing in return. We want this to be a special adventure that you'll remember for the rest of your life.
