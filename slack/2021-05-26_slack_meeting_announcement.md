Gather ‘round hacker-folk, your attention please!

Some special news has come our way, and we’d like to share these good-tidings with everyone out there.

We’ll get together this Saturday (6 PM Eastern :mountain: / 3 PM Pacific :boat:) to spread the news with you. Anyone in the Slack is free to join the call, but the news will only directly impact those of you who can be in the US in the last 2 weeks of July. Keep your eyes trained on :twitter: for clues.

Please react to this message with a :admission_tickets: to reserve your spot on the call. An attendant will stop with a ticket punch & they’ll give further details in DMs.
