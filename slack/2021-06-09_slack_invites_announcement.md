It's Wednesday the 9th of June. On this day in history, Roman Emperor Nero married. This was also the day he committed suicide. But that doesn’t matter to you, does it?

12 days ago, after months of planning, we shared [The Hacker Zephyr](https://zephyr.hackclub.com) with all of you.

Today, our first invites go out. Before you begin refreshing your inboxes, we want to share a bit about the process.

1. **Rolling invites:** Not all invitations go out today! In fact, _very few_ will. Most invitations will trickle out over the next two weeks. We are thoroughly considering every person who registered interest, and that takes time. If you don't get anything today (you probably _won’t_), don't stress about it. It doesn't mean anything! We’ll put the word out once all the spaces are filled and confirmed. Stay tuned ~
2. **Invitation etiquette:** Hack Clubbers who are invited are expected to handle their invitations with class and grace. We’re asking invitation recipients to _not_ share they’ve been invited just yet. _Please don’t ask other Hack Clubbers about their status:_ they’re not allowed to share, and you'll be putting them in an uncomfortable spot. We’re doing this to keep things positive and prevent misunderstandings. After every spot is confirmed, we’ll send an “all clear” so participants can disclose their invitation.
3. **From Hack Club, with love:** We simply can't invite everyone due to hard physical limits. See @melody’s [posts for more on why](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C023JP4JQEM/p1622430831266600?thread_ts=1622402251.494600&cid=C023JP4JQEM). We pushed train capacity to its absolute limit and fought for more seats every step of the way. I can’t express how much of our hearts we’ve put into The Hacker Zephyr, as well as late nights, long discussions, and more phone calls than any of us can count. With all of this in mind, if you do receive an invite then please treasure it. And if you don’t, please understand that this isn’t a reflection of your worth. We’d have you if we could.

I’m happy to answer any questions posted in #zephyr-questions or [zephyr@hackclub.com](mailto:zephyr@hackclub.com) for anything private. Today is going to be crazy chaotic for the whole team, so please be patient if we don’t respond immediately.

Don't forget to be awesome. With lots of love, Max and the Zephyr team
