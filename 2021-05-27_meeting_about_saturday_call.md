# Talk to Zach about the Saturday (launch) call

_In attendance: zrl, msw_

- Everyone hops into a call
- Recording through OBS
- Camera turns on & we talk about how over the last 1.5 years everyone has been stuck inside
- This summer, Hack Club is getting off Zoom
- In the last 2 weeks of summer, ~30 hack clubbers will travel the transcontinental railroad
- They’ll have the opportunity to turn the avatars and usernames into irl faces and names
- They’ll hack on / ship projects together
- They’ll meet a billionaire, Russian political exiles, an acrobat, and more
- Tom’s 42nd birthday was 2 days ago, and as a present to Hack Club he’ll be helping pay for the trip— no one will have to cover their travel/food etc.
- To apply, head to all-aboard.hackclub.com
- Resources available:
	- Parent flyer
	- Sam Video
- This is all we can announce at the moment, but we’ll be revealing more about our plans for everyone else in the coming weeks
