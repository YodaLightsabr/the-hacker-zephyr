Hey everyone! For those that didn’t join us: this summer, Hack Club is chartering the Hacker Zephyr.

After 40+ meetings with groups in America’s train industry, we’ve secured a chartered train to bring 40 hack clubbers on a 10 day trip from sea to shining sea.

Onboard we’ll be hosting the world’s longest hackathon: xxxx miles long. We’ll start at Hack Club HQ in Burlington, Vermont and end up at SpaceX in Los Angeles, California.

The Hacker Zephyr will take place from July 15th to July 25th and will stop in NYC, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.

We’ve been working for months to make this trip happen and this trip his a gift that asks nothing in return from us to you. We are working with a group of philanthropists to covering the cost.

Full details at zephyr.hackclub.com. Registrations of interest are open now on the website and close This Friday, at 11:59 Pacific.

The first Invites will start going out next Wednesday (date), and will be sent over a 2 week period. For more, see #zephyr, #zephyr-questions, and the parent guild (link)
