Gather ‚Äòround hacker-folk, your attention please!

Some special news has come our way, and we‚Äôd like to share these good-tidings with everyone out there.

We‚Äôll get together this Saturday (6 PM Eastern :mountain: / 3 PM Pacific :boat:) to spread the news with you. Anyone in the Slack is free to join the call, but the news will only directly impact those of you who can be in the US in the last 2 weeks of July. Keep your eyes trained on :twitter: for clues.

Please react to this message with a :admission_tickets: to reserve your spot on the call. An attendant will stop with a ticket punch & they‚Äôll give further details in DMs.

### General Announcement (post call)

For those who couldn't make it, **this summer we're chartering a train:** **_The Hacker Zephyr_**.

After 40+ meetings with groups in America‚Äôs train industry, we're sending 42 Hack Clubbers on a 10 day voyage from Hack Club HQ in Burlington, Vermont to Los Angeles, California, where we'll end at SpaceX.Onboard, we're hosting the world's longest hackathon on land: 3,502 miles long. _The Hacker Zephyr_ will take place from July 15th to July 25th and will stop in New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles**_._** 

Together, we'll cross the Great Plains, wind through the Rocky Mountains, follow the coast of California, and more. This trip is a gift from Hack Club to you and asks nothing in return. We want this to be a special adventure that you'll remember for the rest of your life.

[@mischievous-msw ìÅ¢](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U0C7B14Q3), [@sampoder](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/USNPNJXNX), and [@server-wranglin' zachary](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U01DV5F30CF) put together [https://zephyr.hackclub.com](https://zephyr.hackclub.com/) with full details. 

Registrations of interest are open now on the website and close **this Friday, at 11:59 PM Pacific**. 

Even if you're not sure you can make it, please still consider registering interest - doing so is not a commitment.The first invites will start going out next Wednesday (June 9th), and will be sent over a 2 week period. Join us in [#zephyr](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C023JP4JQEM), [#zephyr-questions](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0245M24X96), and consider sharing the parent packet with your folks: [https://hack.af/zephyr-parents](https://hack.af/zephyr-parents). When I did this trip for the first time 2 years ago, it was deeply meaningful and something I'll never forget. I hope you can make it.

### 9/6 Invites Start Going Out

https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0245M24X96/p1623268777014800

It's Wednesday the 9th of June. On this day in history, Roman Emperor Nero married. This was also the day he committed suicide. But that doesn‚Äôt matter to you, does it?

12 days ago, after months of planning, we shared [The Hacker Zephyr](https://zephyr.hackclub.com) with all of you.

Today, our first invites go out. Before you begin refreshing your inboxes, we want to share a bit about the process.

1. **Rolling invites:** Not all invitations go out today! In fact, _very few_ will. Most invitations will trickle out over the next two weeks. We are thoroughly considering every person who registered interest, and that takes time. If you don't get anything today (you probably _won‚Äôt_), don't stress about it. It doesn't mean anything! We‚Äôll put the word out once all the spaces are filled and confirmed. Stay tuned ~
2. **Invitation etiquette:** Hack Clubbers who are invited are expected to handle their invitations with class and grace. We‚Äôre asking invitation recipients to _not_ share they‚Äôve been invited just yet. _Please don‚Äôt ask other Hack Clubbers about their status:_ they‚Äôre not allowed to share, and you'll be putting them in an uncomfortable spot. We‚Äôre doing this to keep things positive and prevent misunderstandings. After every spot is confirmed, we‚Äôll send an ‚Äúall clear‚Äù so participants can disclose their invitation.
3. **From Hack Club, with love:** We simply can't invite everyone due to hard physical limits. See @melody‚Äôs posts for more on why (LINKED). We pushed train capacity to its absolute limit and fought for more seats every step of the way. I can‚Äôt express how much of our hearts we‚Äôve put into The Hacker Zephyr, as well as late nights, long discussions, and more phone calls than any of us can count. With all of this in mind, if you do receive an invite then please treasure it. And if you don‚Äôt, please understand that this isn‚Äôt a reflection of your worth. We‚Äôd have you if we could.

I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions posted in #zephyr-questions or [zephyr@hackclub.com](mailto:zephyr@hackclub.com) for anything private. Today is going to be crazy chaotic for the whole team, so please be patient if we don‚Äôt respond immediately.

Don't forget to be awesome. With lots of love, Max and the Zephyr team

### Invitation List Release

https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0245M24X96/p1625078855210900

:hack_club: hey everyone! :hack_club:

after a massive logistics operation, which included just colossal efforts to get everyone vaccinated, coordinating with embassies and governments, and - in one case - someone literally traveling across the entire world with 24 hour notice :alarm_clock:... i'm happy to be able to share the final passenger list of everyone who will be on the Zephyr.

this has been an extremely difficult and emotionally exhausting process. due to physical constraints, we simply weren't able to invite everyone we wished we could. there were many factors at play in who we extended invitations to. people who received invitations are not better than people who didn't. please, please understand the level of sincerity we are bringing to this :black_heart:

our goal is to open source the Zephyr, including the finances :bank-hackclub:, planning, trip materials, code, and more. as we have more updates on that, i'm going to share more here :eyes:. additionally, there will be opportunities to get involved in the Zephyr without being a passenger on board, including meeting up with us in-person in various cities, contributing code or data to ZephyrNET, and more :sparkles:

without further ado, please see the thread below for the final boarding list.

### Pre Departure Announcement

https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0266FRGT/p1626361458331600

Last night, we had a final get together in Vermont before everyone on The Hacker Zephyr arrives. Right now, as I'm writing this, there are about 40 Hack Clubbers in the air.

This is actually happening. I can feel the magic already.

When I first learned about the hacker ethos as a teenager, I felt like I had finally found my people. And later, I dropped out of high school and moved hundreds of miles away from home when I was 16 to be near them.

I started Hack Club because I so desperately wish I had a place like this. I never had friends my age and the hacker ethos is too powerful an idea to be left to the corners of the internet. When we were struggling to pay rent each month, I always dreamed that someday we would be able run grand initiatives like The Hacker Zephyr to bring Hack Clubbers together. Now it's actually happening.

I am humbled by all of you. You are what makes Hack Club so special. I'm going to be largely offline for the next 10 days, along with many staff, and I am going to miss you. While we're out, @sampoder is taking over the Slack and has a bunch of events and activities planned. I can think of no better person.

Sam, godspeed. And please wish us luck. We're going to open source everything about the trip afterwards. All the code, finances, as many planning documents as possible, everything. This is an anti-hackathon, and I hope it will be special.
